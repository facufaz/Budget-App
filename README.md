Welcome to our App!

This application is designed to help you manage your budget. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for tracking your incomes and expenses, calculating your available budget, and maintaining a list of your financial transactions.

To get started, open the "index.html" file in your web browser. This file serves as the main entry point for the application. It includes the necessary HTML structure and references the required CSS and JavaScript files.

The "index.html" file consists of different sections:

Header: This section displays the available budget, total income, and total expenses.

Form: You can use this form to add new financial transactions. Select the transaction type (income or expense), provide a description, and enter the amount. Click the checkmark button to add the transaction.

List of Incomes and Expenses: This section displays a list of your incomes and expenses separately. Each entry shows the description and amount of the transaction.

The functionality of the application is implemented in the JavaScript files included at the end of the "index.html" file:

"Dato.js": This file defines a base class for representing financial transactions.

"Ingreso.js": This file extends the base class and provides additional functionality specific to income transactions.

"Egreso.js": This file extends the base class and provides additional functionality specific to expense transactions.

"app.js": This file contains the main logic of the application. It handles user interactions, updates the budget calculations, and manages the list of transactions.

The "css/estilos.css" file in the head section of "index.html" contains the styles for the application's visual presentation.

Please note that this app uses the Ionicons library (version 7.1.0) to display icons. The necessary JavaScript files for Ionicons are included at the end of the "index.html" file.

We hope you find this application helpful for managing your budget efficiently. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.
